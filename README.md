# Algorithms
This repository stores pseudocode for all the algorithms that we come across. This could be used to develop better algorithms and to optmize different algorithms to suit better in certain scenarios.

## Heirarchy of the repository
This repository follows should follow strict hierarchy.

Folders for different types of Algorithms
1. Search Algorithms
2. Sorting Algorithms
3. Graph Algorithms
4. Dynamic Programming Algorithms
5. Greedy Algorithms
6. Recursive Algorithms
7. Machine Learning Algorithms
8. Encryption/Decryption Algorithms

The sub-folder (named after the algorithm) will contain the pseudocode ( .md) & implementation (in C++/Java or other languages)
