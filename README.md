# Data Structure & Algorithms (DSA)
A repository to store different types of Data-Structure & Algorithms for educational and research purposes.

This repository is divided into 2 parts:
- [`DataStructure`](DataStructure): Contains the Data Structure
- [`Algorithms`](Algorithms): Contains Alorithms.

Each has its own hierarchy system. The hierarchy is _strict_, and must be followed.

## Hierarchy & Rules
- Directory names should be in `PascalCase`.
- `/Algorithms/AlgorithmCategory/AlgorithmName/README.md` for the pseudocode, info and explaination about that Algorithm.
- `/Algorithms/AlgorithmCategory/AlgorithmName/` for storing code implementation of the Algorithm.
- `/DataStructure/Category/SubCategory/../Name/README.md` for the info and explaination about that Data Structure.
- `/DataStructure/Category/SubCategory/../Name/` for storing code implementation of that Data Structure.
- There could be links to and from the Algorithms or DataStructure dir to link related things.
