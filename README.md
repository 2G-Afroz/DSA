# Algorithms
This repository stores pseudocode for all the algorithms that we come across. This could be used to develop better algorithms and to optmize different algorithms to suit better in certain scenarios.

## Heirarchy
This repository follows should follow strict hierarchy.

Folders for different types of Algorithms

1. **Search Algorithms**
  * Linear Search
  * Binary Search
  * Polynomial Search
2. **Sorting Algorithms**
  * Bubble Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Heap Sort
  * Shell Sort
  * Radix Sort
  * Bubble Sort
3. **Path Finding Algorithms**
  * Dijkstra's algorithm
  * A<sup>*</sup> algorithm
4. **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**
5. **Greedy Algorithms**
6. **Recursive Algorithms**
7. **Machine Learning Algorithms**
8. **Encryption/Decryption Algorithms**

The sub-folder (named after the algorithm) will contain the pseudocode ( .md) & implementation (in C++/Java or other languages)

## Contribution
To contribute, fork the repository, make changes (following the Heirarchy and rules), commit it using appropriate commit message, create a pull request.
