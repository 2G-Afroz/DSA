# Data Structure & Algorithms (DSA)
A repository to store different types of Data-Structure & Algorithms for educational and research purposes.

This repository is divided into 2 parts:
- [`/DataStructure`](DataStructure): Contains the Data Structure
- [`/Algorithms`](Algorithms): Contains Alorithms.

Each has its own hierarchy system. The hierarchy is _strict_, and must be followed.

## Hierarchy & Rules
- Directory names should be in `PascalCase`.
- There could be links to and from the Algorithms or DataStructure dir to link related things.

## `/Algorithms`
The `/Algorithms` directory is organized to accommodate various algorithm implementations, information, explanations, and supplementary details.

Within `/Algorithms`, the following subdirectories represent different categories of algorithms:

- **`/Sort`**: Contains algorithms for sorting data.
- **`/Search`**: Includes algorithms for searching within a list.
- **`/Utils`**: Houses algorithms that serve multiple purposes.

Each category directory (`/Sort`, `/Search`, `/Utils`) further includes directories for specific algorithms.

### Algorithm Directory Template

```plaintext
AlgorithmName/
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          // Containing Pseudocode 
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€ AlgorithmName.xxx  // (optional) Code implementation (.xxx is extention like java, cpp)
```

## `/DataStructure`

The `/DataStructure` directory is structured to house various data structure implementations, information, explanations, and supporting materials.

Within `/DataStructure`, different categories represent various types of data structures:

- **`/Linear`**: Contains implementations of linear data structures.
- **`/NonLinear`**: Encompasses implementations of non-linear data structures.
- **`/HashBased`**: Stores implementations of hash-based data structures.
- **`/Specialized`**: Includes specialized data structures.

Each category directory (`/Linear`, `/NonLinear`, `/HashBased`, `/Specialized`) further contains subdirectories for subcategories of data structures or specific data structures.

### DataStructure Directory Template

```plaintext
DataStructureName/
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             // Containing description & diagram or the structure
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€ DataStrucureName.xxx  // (optional) Code implementation (.xxx is extention like java, cpp)
```
